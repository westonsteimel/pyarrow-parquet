## Description

Produces python wheels for [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow) stripping out all but support for parquet.  
Useful for fitting into AWS Lambda functions.

Moved to stripping components out of official wheels rather than building my own from source at [pyarrow-slim](https://github.com/westonsteimel/pyarrow-slim)
